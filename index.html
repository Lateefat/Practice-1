            <b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is simply dummy text of the printing and 
            typesetting industry. <i>Lorem Ipsum</i> has been the industry's standard 
            dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an <u>unknown printer</u> took a galley of type and 
            <em>scrambled it</em> to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, 
            but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. 
            <hr>
            <br>It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
            and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
